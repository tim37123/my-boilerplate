#Boilerplates

###Plan for this repo
Create a series of branches that cover a number of different boilerplate scenarios :boom:

This is partly to make future dev easier and partly to get a deeper understanding of configuration requirements for the features

###Checklist
**Each item will build upon the previous**

[x] Base Boilerplate (webpack, react, eslint, babel, folder structure)

[] Redux + Router (Redux and React-Router with full feature integration: DevTools, History integration, etc)

[] Sagas (Implement Sagas Middleware)
